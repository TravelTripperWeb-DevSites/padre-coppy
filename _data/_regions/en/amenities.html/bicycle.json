Navigating Miami Beach by bike means the perfect breeze through your hair, and a perfect breeze to find a parking spot, making it the ultimate way to get around for those not looking to leave the island. Washington Park Hotel gives you access to a fleet of 7 custom Martone bikes, designed to get you where you need to go in style, and have fun doing so. </p><p>Bicycle use is included in your daily resort fee and are available on a first-come, first-serve basis.</p>"
