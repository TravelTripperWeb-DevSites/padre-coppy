We've created a space where smart design steals your attention away from your smart phone, where people mix as easily as cocktails. We strive for a human and interactive experience, because humans interacting doesn't happen often enough. Our guests are individuals with unique needs, but we see more than that; we see an evolving community of thinkers and doers, of people choosing to explore life fully. Come see South Beach redone. </p>"
